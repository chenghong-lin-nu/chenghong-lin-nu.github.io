Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is a growing health concern due to rising incidence rates driven by UV overexposure, highlighting the importance of effective sun exposure monitoring. This study introduces a self-sustaining wearable UV sensor that integrates solar energy harvesting, enabling continuous monitoring without frequent recharging. The device provides real-time feedback to encourage sun protection habits, demonstrating its potential to raise UV awareness and promote healthier behaviors.
