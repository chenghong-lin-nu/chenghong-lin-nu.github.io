Wearable camera systems are promising tools for monitoring health-risk behaviors, but analyzing the large amounts of video data they generate is costly and resource-intensive. To address this, we developed a framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to create knowledge graphs (KGs) that represent contextual factors influencing eating behaviors. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining wearable cameras with VLM-driven KGs for scalable and objective analysis of health-risk behaviors in healthcare.
