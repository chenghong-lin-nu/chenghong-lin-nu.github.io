Hi! I’m a fourth-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Northwestern University. My research focuses on bridging Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction. My earlier work delved into symbolic AI, exploring how knowledge bases and analogical reasoning can be utilized to develop systems with human-like reasoning capabilities. Currently, I am leveraging knowledge graphs to create more explainable and personalized healthcare recommendation systems. I’m also passionate about AR/VR technologies and their potential to improve the accessibility of healthcare systems.

Before starting my PhD journey, I earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2020 and a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Zhejiang Normal University in 2018.

Outside of academia, I enjoy an active, outdoor lifestyle. You can often find me cycling 🚴‍♀️, sailing ⛵️, or playing tennis 🎾!
